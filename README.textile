h2. Installation

A short description of my setup:
MODx Evolution RC1 installation with:
# Fetch git repository's snippet dir's contents into /assets/snippets/Gregorian
# Get xPDO (by running these commands, or getting it manually from http://xpdo.org):
- > git submodule init
- > git submodule update
# Create snippet with name "Gregorian" and contents:
<pre><code><?php
return include $modx->config['base_path'] 
    . 'assets/snippets/Gregorian/Gregorian.snippet.php';
?></code></pre>
# Create document with uncached snippet call [!Gregorian!]
# Start filling in events
# Provide feedback ;-)
